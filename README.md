# gumBoot

Hello and welcome,
this is my new home-made project. Have you ever thought, there are so many interesting articles
however they're all spread out! Well gumBoot will be a webscrapper that pools that information into gum and sticks all relevant
information found to you. Like gum to your boot :D!

So the basic conecept, is to create a web scrapper that looks for relevant articles using a dictionary of "key-words".
this will then create a database of these web pages locally for now. Expanding on this part would be to have this database on
my own webpage/domain remotely.

From here I want to create a graphical UI dashboard to present this in a more uniform and clean way.
